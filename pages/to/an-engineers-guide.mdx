  Hello 👋 and welcome to <a href="https://engineers.guide">engineers.guide</a>,
  or <em>An Engineer’s Guide to...</em>. The writing you’ll find here is
  intended to be straightforward, easy to explore, and with plenty of onward
  reading. The target audience is engineers (of any kind, but predominantly
  software engineers), and the subject range will vary within the discipline,
  and in some cases might even jump out to related disciplines, like design,
  law, or public speaking.
</p>
<p>
  The guides are here to introduce a topic within engineering, and give a strong
  foundation for you to go and build on that knowledge. No matter your
  experience, they are written without the need for extensive prior
  understanding. Any relevant pre-reading will be detailed alongside the guide’s
  introduction, and critical concepts will be introduced as part of the guide.
</p>
<p>
  The guides you’ll find on the site, along with all the code that runs it, are
  managed by{" "}
