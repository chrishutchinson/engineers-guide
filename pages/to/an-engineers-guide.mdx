<p>
  Hello 👋 and welcome to <a href="https://engineers.guide">engineers.guide</a>,
  or <em>An Engineer’s Guide to...</em>. The writing you’ll find here is
  intended to be straightforward and easy to digest, with plenty of onward
  reading for the curious. It is aimed at anyone that is interested in learning
  new software engineering concepts. The subject range will vary within the
  discipline, and in some cases might even jump out to related disciplines that
  are useful for professional software engineers, including design, user
  experience and tech compliance.
</p>
<p>
  The guides are here to introduce a topic within engineering, and give a strong
  foundation for you to go and build on that understanding. No matter your
  experience, they are written without the need for extensive prior knowledge.
  Any relevant pre-reading will be detailed alongside the guide’s introduction,
  and critical concepts will be introduced as part of the guide.
</p>

  The guides you’ll find on the site, along with all the code that runs it, are
  managed by{" "}
